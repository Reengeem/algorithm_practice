Well let's try to make it a little harder, we'll have three test cases:
a case where the age is under 10, the passenger will pay only 20% of the real price;
a case where the age is between 10 and 16, the passenger will pay 50% of the ticket price.
a case where the age is above 16, the passenger will pay a full ticket.
The solution will look like:

IF (age<=10) THEN
   ticket_price := 4 ;
ELSE_IF (age<=16) THEN
/*  in this case, we don't specify whether the age is not under 10
because in this case it will satisfy the first condition
and execute the first block of instruction */
   ticket_price := 10 ;
ELSE
   ticket_price := 20 ;
END_IFre under 16, THEN pay half ticket
